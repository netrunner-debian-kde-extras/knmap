Description: KDE interface to nmap, the Network Mapper
 Knmap is a KDE-based interface to the 'nmap' facility available at
 http://www.insecure.org/nmap.
 .
 The main Knmap window provides for the entry of nmap options and the display of
 nmap-generated output.
 .
 This program is a complete re-write of one by the same name written by
 Alexandre Sagala. The last version of that program was 0.9 which was released
 on 2003-03-09 and targeted the KDE 2.2 and QT 2.3 environments.  Unfortunately
 it does not compile on today's KDE / QT environments.
 .
 Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a utility for network exploration or security
 auditing. It supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port
 scanning techniques, version detection, and TCP/IP fingerprinting.
